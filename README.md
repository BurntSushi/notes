notes
=====
This repository is meant to serve as a collection of less rigorous posts or
"notes" that I've written. They might otherwise be blog posts, but they lack
the quality, thought, editing or content that I otherwise strive for in my
blog. They may also be here simply because I consider them off topic for my
blog, which I try to keep focused on technical topics.
